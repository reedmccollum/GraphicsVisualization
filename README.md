What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

    This project gave me a large insight into the concept of 3D perspective.
    
What design process did you follow for your project work?

    I made as many functions modular as possible to ensure that I would make each object in the easiest format
    possible.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    I used a single item in the scenario as reference to base the size and location of all other items.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

    I had to use a single item in the program to base the rest of the objects.
  
How did iteration factor into your development?

    It to many iterations to create and texture any one object correctly.
    
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

    Each milestone for this project was a comprehensive piece of the whole project.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

    I took a much more iterative approach to this project, which I will translate into future projects.
    
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

   I would like to work on game design, and this gave me great insight into first-person perspective.
